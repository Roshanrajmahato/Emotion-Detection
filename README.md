# Emotion-Detection

Understanding human emotions is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project focuses on building machine learning models capable of analyzing text inputs and accurately classifying them into emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and more. Emotion detection enhances human-computer interaction and has wide-ranging applications in areas like customer feedback analysis, mental health monitoring, and social media sentiment tracking.
